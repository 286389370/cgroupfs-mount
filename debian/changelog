cgroup-lite (1.8) raring; urgency=low

  * Change start condition from mounted /sys to mounted /sys/fs/cgroup.
    This fixes a race condition when running mountall, leading to unbootable
    systems in the worst case.
  * Add Depends on mountall (> 2.48~) as the release which first mounts
    /sys/fs/cgroup for us.

cgroup-lite (1.6) raring; urgency=low

  * scripts/cgroups-mount: don't exit out if /sys/fs/cgroup is mounted
    (because mountall now mounts it).  cgroups-umount: don't umount
    /sys/fs/cgroup.

cgroup-lite (1.2) quantal; urgency=low

  * move cgroups-mount and cgroups-umount to /bin, with links in /usr
    (LP: #989354)
  * cgroups-mount: log and exit (with success) if any cgroup fs is mounted
    anywhere (LP: #985884)
  * cgroups-umount: be robust if /sys/fs/cgroup does not exist.

cgroup-lite (1.1) precise; urgency=low

  * debian/cgroup-lite.upstart: Exit cleanly if /sys/fs/cgroup does not exist.
    This happens when running a kernel (such as lucid's during upgrade) that
    does not support cgroups yet. (LP: #929381)

cgroup-lite (1.0) precise; urgency=low

  * Pull cgroup-lite out of libcgroup source package into its own.
  * scripts/cgroups-mount:
    - cleanups per doko, including adding 'set -e' (also in cgroups-umount)
    - add '-n' to cgroupfs mounts like cgroup-bin did.
